## HOW
- Basically, I created a web portfolio's layout that was totally different from the current layout. However, when looking at the old layout I felt there was something that I must improve or add in to catch the positive first impression when the user interacts. Therefore, I searched for many different web design layouts on awwwards.com to find inspiration and spark new idea. I think most websites have the same structure on their layouts, but I finally created a new and creative layout for my web portfolio project. Instead of putting the boring main banner on the main page, I just focus on the typography such as the bigger font size, the lighter font weight on the darker background. For this reason, the whole layout will be able to catch the user's eyes on important information.

## WHY
- Most websites are running a different style of business, and they usually use the catchiest imagery or some unnecessary boxes on their layouts in order to add as much as the information they want. However, for a portfolio, a proper layout which showcases and demonstrates all the products, projects or even a collection of a person is significantly important. Those considerations lead me to create a simple and minimal box style for the content I want to put in. The main trait of my layout is using the dark background which helps me not to be worried about the contrast between texts and imageries. The darker background layout, the lighter texts I use, the more efficient for the user observes. I divide the main navigation into 6 boxes without using drop-down list so that it would help the user to navigate easily.


## WHAT
- Actually, creating a web portfolio is not always the easiest thing for me. I am the person who is really ambitious in what I design or create. Before creating any layout or even any concept, I always spend heaps of time to plan what I need to bring to this project, who I target to, etc. Those targets can definitely help me to use the right style or the most suitable colour to express my website. In the other hand, after learning codes, I realize that the more I plan, the more difficult I code. However, planning really helps as I always believe that fail to plan is plan to fail. From this project, I learned how to prioritize what I have to do first before sitting in front of my computer and actually spending hours for coding.
